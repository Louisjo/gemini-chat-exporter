# Gemini Chat Exporter

**Forked from [Louisjo/gemini-chat-exporter](https://github.com/Louisjo/gemini-chat-exporter.git)**

A Chrome extension that allows you to export your Google Gemini chat conversations to JSON format for backup, analysis, or migration purposes.

## Features

- **Export Full Chat History**: Automatically scrolls to load complete conversation before export, ensuring all messages are captured.
- **Export All Chats**: Export current conversation plus sidebar chat history  
- **Robust Auto-Scroll Loading**: Enhanced logic for lazy-loaded content, with more aggressive scrolling and waiting mechanisms to capture full chat history reliably.
- **Accurate Message Extraction**: Improved message detection and extraction within the DOM to ensure all loaded messages are correctly captured.
- **JSON Format**: Clean, structured data that's easy to process, now including chat metadata and excluding redundant message timestamps.
- **Preserves Formatting**: Maintains code blocks and text structure
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **Enhanced Progress Feedback**: Real-time updates during long conversation loading, including a spinner and message count in the popup.
- **Customizable Filename**: Exported files now include date and time (HH-MM) in the filename for easier organization.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive feedback on success/failure
